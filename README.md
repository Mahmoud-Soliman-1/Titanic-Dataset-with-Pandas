# Titanic-Dataset-with-Pandas
I'm delighted to present my recent work on the Titanic dataset, where I applied various data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques using Pandas. Here's an overview of what I've accomplished:

🔍 Outlier Removal: Identified and removed outliers to ensure a more accurate analysis.

🧹 Data Cleaning: Removed columns that do not contribute to the model, such as names, to streamline the dataset.

📊 Age Classification: Created a new column from the age column to classify passengers into age groups (adult, child, etc.). For missing age values, I replaced them with zero to maintain consistency.

👶 Survivor Analysis by Gender: Calculated the number of male and female survivors to understand the survival patterns based on gender.

👶 Survivor Analysis by Age Group: Analyzed survival rates across different age groups, determining how many infants, children, youths, and elderly passengers survived.

📈 Data Visualization: Visualized all the cleaned data to provide clear and insightful representations of the findings.
