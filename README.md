# Titanic-Dataset-with-Pandas
I'm delighted to present my recent work on the Titanic dataset, where I applied various data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques using Pandas. Here's an overview of what I've accomplished:

 <h3>🔍Outlier Removal: </h3> Identified and removed outliers for more accurate analysis.
 

 <h3>🧹 Data Cleaning: </h3>h3> Removed columns that do not contribute to the model, such as names, to streamline the dataset.
 

 <h3>📊 Age Classification: </h3>h3> Created a new column from the age column to classify passengers into age groups (adult, child, etc.).For missing age values, I replaced them with zero to maintain consistency.
 

 <h3>👶 Survivor Analysis by Gender: </h3>h3> Calculated the number of male and female survivors to understand the survival patterns based on gender.
 

 <h3>👶 Survivor Analysis by Age Group: </h3>h3> Analyzed survival rates across different age groups, determining how many infants, children, youths, and elderly passengers survived.
 

 <h3>📈 Data Visualization: </h3>h3> Visualized all the cleaned data to provide clear and insightful representations of the findings.
